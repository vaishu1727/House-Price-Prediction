# House-Price-Prediction
This project uses XGBoost’s `XGBRegressor` to predict house prices based on various features like crime rate, number of rooms, and location. It includes data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error and R² Score, along with a feature importance plot.
